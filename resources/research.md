# Integrating AI with Web3: Opportunities and Approaches

Combining blockchain and AI unlocks new classes of applications.  Using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** (an open standard for connecting data sources to AI), we can feed live blockchain data into AI agents.  For example, Fetch.ai’s *uagent-evm-mcp* lets a language model query 30+ EVM chains in natural language.  In practice this means an AI could ask “What is vitalik.eth’s ETH balance?” and MCP will translate that into on-chain calls.  Storing AI datasets on decentralized networks (Filecoin, Arweave) also helps ensure data integrity and trust.  Decentralized storage (Filecoin/Arweave) offers tamper-proof, scalable data hosting so AI models can verify and use data without central control.

## Decentralized AI Launchpads

Several Web3 projects are building **AI-focused token launchpads** or incubators.  For example, *Kiwi Pad Bot* is an AI-powered launchpad integrated into Telegram and web3 wallets – the team calls it “the first decentralized AI-powered launchpad bot on EVM chains”.  *ChainGPT* runs an AI launchpad (“ChainGPT Pad & DegenPad”) where stakers of its CGPT token get early access to Web3+AI projects.  Other incubators include *Sahara AI*, which recently launched an AI×Web3 incubator for infrastructure and application startups, and *Units.Network* (on Waves) whose AI Launchpad tool helps developers write smart contracts and tokenomics using AI.  Even the *Aither Protocol* (an AI-agent platform) bundles token launches with its agents via an “AI Agents Launchpad”.  These platforms illustrate how Web3 communities are funding AI projects in a decentralized way.

## Example Products and Use Cases

* **Autonomous AI Agents:** Build AI *bots* that act on-chain.  For instance, **trading bots** can monitor DEX prices and execute orders automatically, and **governance bots** can vote in DAOs on behalf of users based on preset criteria.  QuickNode’s guide on AI agents describes such *Governance Agents* (voting with on-chain reputation) and *Trading Agents* (analyzing prices and trading) as key types.  Other agent ideas: **DeFi automation bots** to rebalance liquidity or auto-compound rewards, **NFT monitoring bots** to alert on rare mints or listings, or **game economy agents** managing on-chain game assets and quests.  Because these agents operate via smart contract triggers or SDKs, they inherently integrate on-chain data (wallet balances, tx history, events) into their decision-making.

* **Decentralized Inference & Compute:**  You can build systems that **bring AI to the data** on a blockchain.  For example, PAI3’s vision of *decentralized inference* is to run AI models on your own data privately, rather than sending data to a central server.  Projects like *Nosana* (on Solana) are creating a decentralized GPU marketplace for AI inference (leveraging idle GPUs for cheap cloud compute).  On NEAR, a purpose-built AI blockchain, they support *encrypted model execution* and *multichain AI agents*.  An AI product could use such networks to do inference (e.g. offloading ML tasks to decentralized compute providers) while owning and verifying models via smart contracts.

* **AI + NFT “Memory”:**  One novel idea is to let an AI agent mint **NFTs as memory or milestones**.  For example, the Aither Protocol calls this “NFT Memory Albums”: an AI agent captures its key milestones (viral posts, achievements, jokes) and mints them as collectible NFTs.  These on-chain “memory albums” can then be traded or displayed, aligning the agent’s experiences with tokenized assets.  This merges AI logs with NFTs, so each token is a verifiable record of the agent’s history.  You could build an AI diary service where the agent’s learnings or outputs are minted and sold on OpenSea for revenue.

* **Smart-Contract Automation:**  Integrate AI into contract development and execution.  ChainGPT already offers an AI *Solidity generator/auditor*—you describe a smart contract, and their AI drafts or audits the code.  Similarly, you could use language models to write tests or deployment scripts and then have them executed on Ethereum via a MetaMask or wallet-signing plugin.  With MCP, the AI can directly call contract methods: for example, triggering a token swap or reading state by typing a natural-language instruction.

* **On-Chain Data Analytics & Feeds:**  AI can crunch on-chain data for users. For instance, integrate AgentGPT or a similar LLM with QuickNode/Alchemy endpoints to produce real-time analytics (price predictions, sentiment analysis, trend spotting).  The Fetch.ai *uagent* shows how an AI can query any ERC20/NFT info in plain language (e.g. “how many NFTs does a given address own?”).  Products could include AI dashboards, or bots that automatically summarize DAO proposals or protocol metrics for users, leveraging APIs or MCP.

* **DAO Participation & Governance:**  AI tools can help communities make decisions.  A product might use on-chain reputation data to **automatically vote** in governance proposals via smart contracts.  (QuickNode notes that governance agents can vote based on on-chain reputation or a user’s indicated preferences.)  An AI assistant could even craft a new proposal and automatically submit it if certain criteria are met.  This uses web3 primitives (voting functions, token checks) under the hood but is driven by AI logic.

* **Tokenized Incentives & Payments:**  Incorporate crypto tokens for AI usage.  For example, Aither’s design charges users in tokens for AI API calls: each request deducts \$AITHER from the user’s wallet and automatically buys back and burns agent tokens.  This pattern lets end-users pay an AI service in crypto, with transparent on-chain accounting.  You could similarly build an AI SaaS where users pay with ETH or an ERC20 for each query, and use smart contracts to handle subscription or microtransactions.

## Architecture: App, Infra, or B2B

You can position your product at different layers.  As an **end-user app**, it might be a chat or voice assistant integrated with wallets (like a Telegram bot or mobile app) that lets users manage crypto via AI.  Kiwi Pad Bot is an example of a front-end AI tool (Telegram-based launchpad).  As **infrastructure/B2B**, you could offer APIs or SDKs: ChainGPT provides an AI SDK so developers and businesses can call its LLM for Web3 functions, and Fetch.ai offers developer tools (Agentverse) for building on-chain AI agents.  On the **protocol/infrastructure** side, you might build a middleware (like a blockchain oracle with AI insights, or a decentralized inference network) that other dApps can plug into.  For example, deploying MCP adapters for web3 lets any developer have AI access to on-chain context.

## Supporting Technologies (Ethereum and Beyond)

Leverage the wider Web3 ecosystem as context.  On Ethereum-compatible chains (Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.) you can use existing DeFi and NFT data.  On other blockchains: *Solana* has projects like **Nosana** (decentralized GPU network) and **Synesis One** (AI data marketplace) that can power AI apps; *NEAR* explicitly positions itself as “blockchain for AI” with privacy-preserving compute and multi-chain agents; *Arweave* and *Filecoin* offer permanent storage for ML datasets or logs; *Ocean Protocol* (across many chains) provides a data marketplace for feeding AI.  Decentralized identity (Worldcoin, Ceramic) oracles (Chainlink) and DePIN (e.g. IoTeX for on-chain AI data infrastructure) are all complementary.  By integrating these protocols, an AI+Web3 product can store large data off-chain (Filecoin), run on-chain logic (Ethereum smart contracts), and access fast layer-1 networks (Solana/NEAR) as needed.

## Building “iris-v4” in AI+Web3

To build your IRIS‑v4 product, start by defining the value layer: agent or model versus orchestration.  If it’s an AI agent (e.g. chatbot, assistant, analytics bot), use MCP or SDKs to hook into blockchain data (as Fetch.ai’s uAgent does).  For example, run a LangChain-based service that uses an EVM adapter to read wallet/contract info and generate responses.  Consider enabling a wallet-signing front end so the AI can execute transactions (swaps, votes) via smart contracts.  Use NFTs or tokens to record or monetize the agent’s memory or output (inspired by Aither’s NFT Memory).

If IRIS‑v4 is more of an infrastructure/platform, focus on developer tools or protocols.  You could create a library that wraps blockchain RPC calls in natural-language prompts (leveraging MCP), or a hosting layer where models are verified on-chain (storing model hashes on Filecoin for provenance).  Engaging B2B clients might mean offering API keys for large-volume access (ChainGPT style), while consumer apps might use a token gating or usage-fee model.

**Takeaway:** Use on-chain data and crypto incentives to give your AI context and value.  Examples above range from **agentic bots** (trading/governance agents), to **decentralized inference networks** (PAI3, Nosana), to **NFT-minted AI memories**.  Leverage Ethereum’s DeFi/NFT ecosystem and expand to chains like Solana and NEAR for scale or specialized features.  By combining smart contract execution, DAO interactions, and token payments, IRIS‑v4 can seamlessly integrate Web3 capabilities into its AI workflows.
