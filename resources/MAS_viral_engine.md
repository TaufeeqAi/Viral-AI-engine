### 1. Overview of Multi-Agent System for the AI Viral Engine
A multi-agent system for this platform would consist of interconnected AI agents, each responsible for a specific function (e.g., data scraping, prediction, content creation, or promotion). These agents operate semi-autonomously, communicate with each other, and leverage an LLM (like Grok) for decision-making, content generation, or analysis. The system supports the SRS’s requirements by:
- **Parallel Processing**: Agents handle simultaneous tasks (e.g., scraping TikTok while scoring trends).
- **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on a niche (e.g., sentiment analysis vs. token management).
- **Scalability**: Agents can be added or adjusted to handle increased data or user load.
- **Coordination**: Agents share data and decisions to ensure cohesive trend launches.

The system aligns with the SRS’s emphasis on real-time trend prediction, automated content creation, and blockchain integration (e.g., prediction markets, tokens).

### 2. Agent Roles and Responsibilities
Based on the SRS, the following agents can be designed to cover the platform’s key functions. Each agent uses AI (potentially LLM-based) and interacts with others via a central coordinator or direct communication.

#### 2.1 Data Collection Agent
- **Purpose**: Fetches trend data from sources (TikTok, Reddit, X, Google Trends) as per FR3.2.
- **Tasks**:
  - Use APIs (e.g., TikTok Trends API, Reddit API) or ethical web crawlers to collect real-time data on hashtags, posts, searches, and engagement metrics.
  - Monitor mentions of topics across platforms (FR1.4).
  - Clean and preprocess data (e.g., remove duplicates, normalize formats).
- **Tools**: Python libraries (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy), no-code tools (Apify, Octoparse), or APIs from ViralStat/Semrush.
- **Output**: Structured datasets (e.g., JSON with post IDs, views, likes, timestamps).
- **Interaction**: Sends data to Prediction Agent and Scoring Agent; receives instructions on new sources from Coordinator Agent.

#### 2.2 Prediction Agent
- **Purpose**: Predicts hottest topics hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly (FR1.1).
- **Tasks**:
  - Use machine learning models (e.g., time-series forecasting, LSTM) to identify emerging trends.
  - Filter out outlier influences (e.g., celebrity-driven events) to focus on organic trends.
  - Incorporate a “search engine meta finder” to aggregate search engine insights.
- **Tools**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or LLM-based forecasting (e.g., Grok with DeepSearch mode).
- **Output**: List of predicted topics with metadata (e.g., category, platform, growth rate).
- **Interaction**: Receives raw data from Data Collection Agent; sends predictions to Scoring Agent.

#### 2.3 Scoring Agent
- **Purpose**: Assigns virality scores (0-100) to predicted topics (FR1.3).
- **Tasks**:
  - Analyze factors: audience size/demographics, regions, similar past trends, key personalities, engagement metrics.
  - Use data from similar platforms (e.g., Semrush API, Exploding Topics) for benchmarking.
  - Flag topics with 90+ scores for launch.
- **Tools**: LLM for sentiment analysis, statistical models for scoring, APIs for historical trends.
- **Output**: Scored topics with justification (e.g., “90: High TikTok engagement in US”).
- **Interaction**: Receives predictions from Prediction Agent; sends high-scoring topics to Launch Agent.

#### 2.4 Content Generation Agent
- **Purpose**: Automates creation of trend pages and content (FR2.1).
- **Tasks**:
  - Generate narrative summaries, project details, descriptions, and logos for trend pages.
  - Create promotional content (e.g., tweets, TikTok scripts) tailored to platforms.
  - Populate token pages with activity and sentiment data (FR2.4).
- **Tools**: LLM (e.g., Grok for text generation), AI image tools (e.g., DALL-E for logos).
- **Output**: Fully populated trend pages, social media posts, visual assets.
- **Interaction**: Receives high-scoring topics from Scoring Agent; sends content to Promotion Agent.

#### 2.5 Launch Agent
- **Purpose**: Manages “cult launches” for high-scoring trends (FR2.1).
- **Tasks**:
  - Initiate trend launches with 90+ scores, creating token pools or liquidity pools.
  - Integrate prediction markets for betting on trend outcomes (FR2.2).
  - Implement Anti-MEV dynamic fees for blockchain transactions (FR2.4).
- **Tools**: Blockchain APIs (e.g., Ethereum, Web3.js), smart contract templates.
- **Output**: Launched trend pages with active markets and token pools.
- **Interaction**: Receives trend data from Scoring Agent; coordinates with Promotion Agent for rollout.

#### 2.6 Promotion Agent
- **Purpose**: Deploys AI bots on X for engagement and promotion (FR2.3).
- **Tasks**:
  - Post, retweet, and interact with trend-related content on X.
  - Update agent profile with all trend-related activity.
  - Respond to mentions and engage with trending hashtags.
- **Tools**: X API (premium), LLM for generating responses, automation frameworks (e.g., n8n).
- **Output**: Increased trend visibility via X interactions.
- **Interaction**: Receives content from Content Generation Agent; reports engagement metrics to Analytics Agent.

#### 2.6 Analytics Agent
- **Purpose**: Displays trend analytics and insights on the user dashboard (FR2.5).
- **Tasks**:
  - Aggregate interactions, sentiment, and activity across platforms (FR2.4).
  - Visualize data by region, category, or time frame.
  - Provide real-time updates (every 5-15 minutes, per NFR1).
- **Tools**: Chart.js for visualizations, MongoDB for data storage, LLM for sentiment analysis.
- **Output**: Interactive dashboard with charts, metrics, and trend summaries.
- **Interaction**: Receives data from all agents; provides feedback to Coordinator Agent.

#### 2.7 Coordinator Agent
- **Purpose**: Manages agent interactions and workflow orchestration.
- **Tasks**:
  - Assign tasks based on system goals (e.g., prioritize new trends).
  - Resolve conflicts (e.g., contradictory predictions).
  - Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines (e.g., rate-limiting crawlers).
- **Tools**: Agent orchestration platforms (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI), message queues (RabbitMQ).
- **Output**: Seamless operation across agents.
- **Interaction**: Communicates with all agents; logs system performance.

#### 2.8 API Agent
- **Purpose**: Exposes APIs for external integration (FR3.1).
- **Tasks**:
  - Provide endpoints for trend predictions, scores, and launches.
  - Allow users to query specific tokens or trends.
  - Ensure secure access (e.g., API keys, rate limits).
- **Tools**: RESTful API frameworks (FastAPI, Flask), OAuth for authentication.
- **Output**: Public API endpoints (e.g., /trends/predict).
- **Interaction**: Receives data from Analytics and Scoring Agents; serves external developers.

### 3. Multi-Agent System Architecture
The MAS can be structured as follows:
- **Centralized Coordination**: The Coordinator Agent acts as a hub, managing task delegation and data flow. Agents communicate via APIs or message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- **Decentralized Execution**: Each agent operates independently, using local LLMs or APIs for tasks, but syncs with the Coordinator for updates.
- **Data Flow**:
  - Data Collection → Prediction → Scoring → Content Generation → Launch → Promotion → Analytics → API.
  - Feedback loops: Analytics Agent reports metrics to Prediction Agent for model refinement.

### 4. Practical Applications of Multi-Agent System
The MAS enhances the platform by addressing SRS requirements in the following ways:
- **Real-Time Trend Prediction (FR1.1)**: Data Collection and Prediction Agents work in tandem to fetch and analyze data, ensuring hourly/daily updates.
- **Virality Scoring (FR1.3)**: Scoring Agent uses LLM-driven sentiment analysis and historical data to assign accurate scores, reducing human bias.
- **Automated Launches (FR2.1)**: Content Generation and Launch Agents streamline page creation and token pool setup, enabling rapid “cult launches.”
- **Cross-Platform Promotion (FR2.3)**: Promotion Agent amplifies trends on X, increasing visibility and engagement.
- **Scalable Analytics (FR2.5)**: Analytics Agent provides customizable dashboards, meeting NFR1’s performance requirements.
- **API Integration (FR3.1)**: API Agent enables third-party developers to build on the platform, aligning with the SRS’s vision for extensibility.
- **Blockchain Features (FR2.4)**: Launch Agent’s Anti-MEV fees and prediction markets add a gamified, decentralized layer, unique compared to platforms like ViralStat.
